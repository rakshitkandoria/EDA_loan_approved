# 🚀 Loan Approval Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
Welcome to the **Loan Approval Analysis** project! This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a 🏦 **Loan Approval Dataset** to uncover insights into loan approval trends and applicant characteristics.

### 🔍 The dataset includes details about:
- 👤 **Applicant Information** (🧑‍💼 Gender, 💍 Marital Status, 👨‍👩‍👧 Dependents, 🎓 Education, 💼 Self-Employed Status)
- 💰 **Financial Details** (💵 Applicant Income, 🤝 Coapplicant Income, 🏦 Credit History)
- 🏡 **Loan Information** (💳 Loan Amount, ⏳ Loan Term, 📍 Property Area)

### 🎯 Project Goals:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 🧹  
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis 🔬  
📉 Identifying Trends & Insights 💡  
📈 Data Visualization with Charts & Plots 🎨  

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **Dataset:** Loan Approval Dataset 📄  
- 📥 **Access Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madhansing/bank-loan2  
- 🔢 **Size:** 367 records, 12 columns  
- ❌ **Missing Values:** Gender, Dependents, Self-Employed, Loan Amount, Loan Term, and Credit History  

## 🛠 Data Preprocessing
✔ 🔄 **Renamed Columns** for better readability  
✔ 🏗 **Handled Missing Values** (Mode & Median Imputation)  
✔ 🔢 **Converted Categorical Data** into Numerical Format  
✔ 🚨 **Identified & Treated Outliers** (Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income, Loan Amount)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1️⃣ Univariate Analysis 📌
- 📉 **Histograms:** Distribution of Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income & Loan Amount  
- 📦 **Box Plots:** Outlier detection in numerical variables  
- 📊 **Bar Charts:** Frequency of categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Education, Property Area)  
- 🥧 **Pie Charts:** Proportions of different categorical variables  

### 2️⃣ Bivariate Analysis 🔍
- 📈 **Scatter Plots:** Relationship between numeric variables (e.g., Income vs Loan Amount)  
- 📊 **Box & Violin Plots:** Comparing numeric variables across categories (e.g., Loan Amount by Education)  
- 🔥 **Heatmaps:** Correlation between numerical features  

### 3️⃣ Multivariate Analysis 📊
- 🏗 **Stacked Bar Charts:** Showed distributions of categorical variables across multiple groups
